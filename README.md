This project combines the use of file I/O and exceptions. The original was written by Dr. Jim Williams, with some added methods by Keith Lienert

The initial program parses the story to find the parameters within the pair of brackets []. These are then prompted to the user to fill in (i.e. "noun", "verb", etc.).

Additionally, separate files will be accessed to provide multiple stories to work with.

**UPDATE - 11/28/2021
New IO functions added

To be added later...
1) new options for user (picking a number to select the file instead of typing it in)
2) Error handling for the above options

Once upon a midnight [ADJECTIVE], while I pondered [ADJECTIVE] and [ADJECTIVE],
Over many a quaint and curious [ADJECTIVE] of forgotten [ADJECTIVE],
While I [VERB ENDING IN "ED"], nearly napping, suddenly there came a [VERB ENDING IN "ED"],
As of [VERB ENDING IN "ED"] gently rapping, rapping at my [VERB ENDING IN "ED"] door.
``Tis some [VERB ENDING IN "ED"],` I muttered, `tapping at my [VERB ENDING IN "ED"] door -
Only this, and nothing more.`

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the [VERB ENDING IN "ED"] December,
And each separate [VERB ENDING IN "ED"] ember wrought its [VERB ENDING IN "ED"] upon the floor.
Eagerly I [VERB ENDING IN "ED"] the morrow; - [ADVERB] I had sought to borrow
From my [NOUN (PLURAL)] surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the [NOUN (PLURAL)] Lenore -
For the [NOUN (PLURAL)] and [NOUN (PLURAL)] maiden whom the angels named [FEMALE NAME] -
Nameless here for evermore.
